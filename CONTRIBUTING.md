# Why contributing?

The purpose of this project is to have fun together. For some people it will be adding interesting features, for others, it could be a good introduction to collaborative programming.

The village will always remain open source, but you are free to reuse its code for your own purpose, as long as you give back proper credit.

# All contributions are welcome

Code is important to actually run the game, but your contribution can go beyond programming: 
- sharing assets / cosmetics for the village and its villagers
- sharing sound / music
- adding features / mods
