# The Village
Life simulation written in Python and visualized using Arcade

# Concept

This project is an attempt at collaborative game development, aimed at beginners and hobbyists, but everyone's help is welcome.

It draws its inspiration from the Game of Life + The Sims + Sim Ant/Sim City + Dwarf Fortress types of games. 
You have a village where you can program villagers traits and behaviors, then you run the simulation and watch them experience the world around them.

You can alter any part of the village and villagers, adding traits, motivations, etc. 

There is no interaction during the game, apart from the time factor. Once a game has started, there is nothing you can do to alter its course until the end of its execution. But you can always tweak it and start a new village.

# Where can I find more information?

Once there is a working prototype, documentation will be welcome.

You can also join the project [Discord server](https://discord.gg/qh96QwY).
Progress on the project is also live-streamed on [Twitch](https://www.twitch.tv/wiseoldg33k).

# How can I play?

Currently there is not release that you can just run on your computer. 
You will need to setup a development environment (see below) in order to play the game. 


# Setup your development environment
You can follow the instructions in the **excellent** [Arcade book](https://learn.arcade.academy/chapters/02_setup/setup.html).
It contains setup instructions for all systems supported by Arcade.
If it's your first time with Arcade, you probably want to read a few sections of the Arcade book before jumping in the code. 
Once you have this covered, you can clone this repository on your local computer, and start having fun.



# Requirements
- Python 3.7 (Arcade tends to not work with other versions)
- the Arcade library (any recent version will do)

To install all the requirements, simply run the following command:
```shell
 $ pip install -r requirements.txt
```
